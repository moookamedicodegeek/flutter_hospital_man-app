# hospital_management_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

I created a Hospital Management Mobile Application using Flutter, Dart, and Firebase. The 
application includes Authentication Functionalities, Appointment Booking, 
Appointment Deletion, Patient Profile Updating,Notification view and Deletion Integration with Firebase for Data Storage, A 
Review feature for patients to provide feedback on the service they received. Additionally, 
a System Admin page where the system administrator can view appointments, 
reviews, and have the authority to delete both appointments and reviews made by the patients.


For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
